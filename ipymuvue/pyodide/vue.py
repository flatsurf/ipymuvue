r"""
The Vue API in Python.

This module is automatically provided with the "assets" available when defining
vue components.

The general strategy of this module is to make sure that Vue.js never sees any
pyodide PyProxy objects and that the Python developer is not bothered with
JsProxy objects. The former is necessary for Vue to function, the latter is
mostly a convenience.

==============================
Accessing the Vue API directly
==============================

We export the `vue` module as `Vue`. If you know what you are doing, it can be
used to call into Vue directly using its JavaScript API. Note that calling
into Vue with any Python objects that are not primitives such as int or bool is
likely not going to work reliably.

Things tend to go wrong when Vue is presented any PyProxy objects, i.e., proxy
objects that live in JavaScript and wrap a Python object. The truth is that
it's not clear to us what exactly is the problem here but there seem to be
issues when Vue is installing its own proxy on the PyProxy. This changes the
identity of these objects, so pyodide is going to rewrap these proxies using a
JsProxy. Also, methods called on these objects are not going through the Vue
proxy machinery.

In the opposite direction, there is essenially the same problem. It's certainly
very inconvenient for Python developers to be able to call into Vue with Python
objects such as dicts and lists and at the same time receive JsProxy objects
that are Object and Array since the interface of the former is quite different
from a dict. The bigger problem here is however, if we return a reactive Object
to Python at some point, Python code might modify it and insert a PyProxy such
as a dict somewhere. We can't really do anything about such operations and Vue
is going to stop to function as outlined above. So our strategy here is to make
sure that the objects we return are proxy objects that emulate a Python
interface such as :class:`ProxyDict`, :class:`ProxyList` and at the same time
rewrite all modifications to be compatible with Vue's expectations. Sometimes,
we also return read-only objects or just convert things to dicts or lists if we
find that the connection to the Vue machinery is not needed and such conversion
is easier.
